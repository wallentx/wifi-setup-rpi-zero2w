AP_NAME=piratos

# Password for the WiFi access point (minimum 8 characters)
# IMPORTANT: Change this default password to a strong, unique password before deployment
AP_PASSWORD=raspberry

# Time to wait for network connection to establish (in seconds)
# Default: 10 seconds. Increase if connecting to slow networks or networks with slow DHCP
CONNECTION_WAIT_TIME=10

# Connection Monitoring and Retry Configuration

# Interval between connection health checks (in seconds)
# Default: 30 seconds. Lower values detect drops faster but use more CPU

# Number of retry attempts before falling back to AP mode
# Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable retries
CONNECTION_RETRIES=1

# Delay between retry attempts (in seconds)
# Default: 5 seconds

# Circuit Breaker Configuration - prevents rapid AP restart loops

# Maximum number of AP restarts allowed within the time window
# Default: 3. If exceeded, exponential backoff is applied
MAX_RESTARTS_PER_WINDOW=3

# Time window for counting restarts (in seconds)
# Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
RESTART_WINDOW=300

# Exponential backoff multiplier for circuit breaker
# Default: 6. Creates backoff sequence: 5s -> 30s -> 3min
